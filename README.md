# T.A.R.A.L.L.O.
Trabiccolo Amministrazione Rottami e Assistenza, Legalmente-noto-come L'inventario Opportuno

Server in PHP e (My)SQL (anche se forse un NoSQL sarebbe stato più adatto) del programma che usiamo per gestire l'inventario dei vecchi computer accatastati in laboratorio, nonché di quelli donati ad associazioni e scuole a cui facciamo assistenza.

## Installation

### Developement

Install Vagrant and Ansible and run:

	make vm

this will install a Vagrant plugin and Ansible roles.
    
If you want to do that manually check the `Makefile` to see what's needed, since
all plugins go *outside of the project directory* (probably somewhere in your
home directory).

**If you're running Windows** you won't be able to run Ansible, see the
"Developing on Windows" section below.

Then do:
	
	vagrant up

and you will get:

* T.A.R.A.L.L.O. instance accessible at `127.0.0.1:8080`
* Some sample data, which right now is only 4 users and that's it
(user: `asd`, password: `asd`, all users have password `asd`)
* APIs at `127.0.0.1:8080/v1/` (also used internally by the HTML interface)
* Xdebug enabled by default
* Xdebug profiler enabled, start it via trigger (`?XDEBUG_PROFILE=1` or browser extensions),
saves output to `xdebug` directory
* Adminer at `127.0.0.1:8081/adminer.php` for database inspection (user: root,
password: root, server: localhost:3306)
* Database accessible externally by root at `127.0.0.1:3307` (note the non-standard port)
* phpinfo at `127.0.0.1:8081/phpinfo.php`

If port gets changed from 8080 to anything else by Vagrant no manual adjustments
should be necessary but this hasn't been tested.

There are two databases: `tarallo`, which is the one used by the interface and
the APIs, and `tarallo_test`, which is populated and used only when running
PHPUnit tests.

The `vagrant-vbguest` plugin is required because the default CentOS 7 image lacks
VirtualBox additions, needed for folder sharing. CentOS was chosen since that's
what we're using on the production server.

#### Developing on Windows

You'll need to install Vagrant and the vagrant-vbguest plugin:
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`.

Then do `vagrant up`. Vagrant should recognize that you're on Windows
and run `utils/provision/windows-host.sh` : it will install Ansible
and its plugins *inside* the virtual machine and provision it.

This appears to work but hasn't been tested thoroughly, so be warned.

### Production

The program doesn't really need to be built, but there's a Makefile that
collects in a single directory named `build` all the files you'll need to
upload, installs dependencies and builds an optimized autoloader. To do that,
run:

    make

At the end you may get this warning (complete with shoddy warning signs):

    /!\ No db-production.php found, add your own db.php in the 'build' directory /!\

Copy `db-example.php` to `build/db.php` and edit it to suit your needs.

Or you could name it `db-production.php` and place it in the main directory:
when running `make` again, it will be copied to `build/db.php`.

Also remember to import `database.sql`, `database-data.sql` and
`database-procedures.sql` in the production database, if they've changed from
last deployment.

## More details

### Database

The schema is located in `database.sql`.

`database-data.sql` contains some "static" data needed for the software to work.
It can be edited, but you'll need to run `make features` afterwards.

`database-procedures.sql` contains some procedures and triggers, all of these
are needed for the entire thing to work.

### Feature list generation

`generate-features /path/to/this/directory` reads the feature list from
`database-data.sql`, converts it to PHP data structures and places it into
`src/Database/Feature.php` and some other files (`generate-features` tells you
which ones when it's finished).

The prefererred way to run this script is to use `make features` instead of
calling it directly. This is a CLI script, you shouldn't upload it to a server
or access it from the browser.

Modified files should be manually reviewed and committed.

### Router cache

To enable FastRoute cache, set `CACHE_ENABLED` to true in `db.php`.

Caching probably won't work in developement, so you could enable it
only in `db-production.php` (which `make` copies to `build/db.php`).

Cache files in `build` directory are generated automatically when
running `make`.

### Gettext

There are a few references to that through the source code, but it's
**currently unused**.

In theory, to generate .po and .mo these commands should be enough, but
**there are no strings to translate yet** so they won't do anything useful:

    xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -o SSRv1/locale/it_IT/LC_MESSAGES/tarallo.pot **/*.php
    msgfmt tarallo.pot -o tarallo.mo
